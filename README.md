## Project 4 - Arcade Game

This is my take on the classic Frogger

### Description
 - The game randomly assigns speeds to the enemies. controll the player with the arrow keys to get him from the grass ot the water. 
 - Enemies get quicker with every lap but slow down again after a while.
 - When the player gets to the water he earns a [life](images/Heart.png)] and a [star](images/Star.png) and returns to his initial spot.
 - Each 5 [gems](images/Gem\ Blue.png) collected exchange themselves for 1 life. 
 - The game finishes when the player loses all his lives. If the player never loses, the game never ends.
